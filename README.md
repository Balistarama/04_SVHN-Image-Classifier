##04_SVHN Image Classifier
Using the Street View House Numbers (SVHN) Dataset, this project is a state of
the art Deep Convolutional Neural Network image to number classifier.

This project is the final task in the Udacity Deep Learning course by Google 
that can be found here: https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730

##OBJECTIVE:
Build an application that can interpret numbers from real-world images.

##TODO:
- Setup a function that automatically parses the next "batch" of test data and labels <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Balistarama/04_SVHN-Image-Classifier/master/tick.png">
- Commplete the data_processor.py file and functions

##INSTRUCTIONS:
 - Clone repository
 - Follow the data/README to download and munge the raw dataset
 - Run the src/main.py Neural Network
